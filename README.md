In the day 3 I have learn about the OOPâ€™S CONCEPT and made the program of some problems based on { Creating a class hierarchy using method overriding, Designing an abstract class, Demonstrating runtime polymorphism, Implementing encapsulation , Creating an Interface }.

The problems are as following:-

Q1. Create a class hierarchy with a base class Shape and derived classes Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle. Use method overriding to calculate the area of each shape.

Q2. Design an abstract class Vehicle with abstract methods start() and stop(). Implement this class in Car and Bike classes with appropriate behavior.

Q3. Demonstrate runtime polymorphism by creating a class Employee and subclasses Manager and Developer. Each subclass should override a method called work().

Q4. Implement encapsulation by creating a class BankAccount with private fields accountNumber, balance. Provide public getters and setters with validation (e.g.balance cannot be negative).

Q5. Create an interface Flyable with a method fly(). Implement this interface in classes Bird and Airplane. Demonstrate interface implementation.
